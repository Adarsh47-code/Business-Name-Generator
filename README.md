# Business-Name-Generator
This small project generates business name using three-word types (Adjectives, Shop name, A random suffix)

Welcome to the dojo of disciplined logic. This project is a JavaScript-based business name generator built under strict constraints:
❌ No arrays allowed.
✅ Only functions, strings, variables, and conditionals.

It’s a tribute to raw problem-solving, creative branding, and saga-style growth.
## Features
1. generates random business name using Adjectives, Shop types, Suffixes.
2. Uses pure logic to create 27 unique combos.
3. Built with:
    a. match.random for randomness.
    b. If-else trees for selection.
    c. Template literals  for clean output.
 4. No arrays. No shortcut Just builder grit.

##  Why This Project Matters
This isn’t just a name generator—it’s a discipline test.
Inspired by a strict YouTube mentor challenge, this project proves that:
• 	You can build scalable logic without arrays
• 	You can create dynamic output using only fundamentals
• 	You can turn constraints into creativity
It’s part of my saga toward launching Monkey Webworks, a web dev agency powered by grit, branding, and transformation.

## Future Upgrades
• 	Add CLI input for custom adjectives and shop types
• 	Create a badge tracker for favorite combos
• 	Build a GUI version with dropdowns and preview
• 	Unlock arrays in  for loop-based generation

 ## License
This project is open-source and part of my personal saga.
Feel free to fork, remix, or use it in your own dojo.
